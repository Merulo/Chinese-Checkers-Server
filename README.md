# Chinese Checkers Server

This is a server version for Chinese Checkers Game.
Created for TP classes, 3rd semester, Computer Science, Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology, Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

### Main goals

* Show benefits and drawbacks of using UML before and after creating parts of program
* Gain fundamental skills in programming cooperation
* Encourage usage of version control system
* Practise in real environment usage of GRASP
* Master the recognition and usage of design patterns created by GOF
* Learn about the benefits and drawbacks of tests and test driven development

### About this program

My main principle was to design this server in a way that represents everything what I have learned.
The other thing I had in mind when designing was openness for change and addition. Modification of this code for other games should be quite simple; additional interfaces might be necessary.

### Usage

Due to lack of time and some missed milestones I was unable to create server GUI.
This resulted in almost non-configurable server.
Compile and start the server then
compile and start the [client](https://github.com/Merulo/Chinese-Checkers-Client).

### Wish list:

* Add server GUI with a command line for control of games and players
* Add server settings
* Add Logger-like class for logging changes and events
* ~~Establish different languages (currently we are using a mix of polish & english)~~ Polish is main language
* Add translator class for server messages

## Authors
