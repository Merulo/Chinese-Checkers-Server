# Chinese Checkers Server

This is a server version for Chinese Checkers Game.
Crated for TP classes, 3rd semester, Computer Science, Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology, Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

### Main goals

* Show benefits and drawbacks of using UML before and after creating parts of program
* Gain fundamental skills in programming cooperation
* Encourage usage of version control system
* Practise in real environment usage the design principles (GRASP)
* Master the recognition and usage of design patterns created by GOF
* Learn about the benefits and drawbacks of tests and test driven development

### About this program

My main principle was to design this server in a way that represents everything what i have learned.
The other thing i had in mind when designing was openness for change and addition. Modification of this code for other games should be quite simple; additional interfaces might be necessary.

### Usage

Due to lack of time and some missed milestones i was unable to create server GUI.
This resulted in almost non-configurable server.
Compile and start the server then
compile and start the [client](https://github.com/Merulo/Chinese-Checkers-Client).

### TODO

* Add GUI for server with command line for control of games flow
* Add server settings
* Add Logger-like class for logging changes and events
* ~~Establish different languages (currently we are using a mix of polish & english)~~ Polish is main language
* Add translator for server messages
